# DieBauLogin

Task : Create a Login screen without service calls. 
In the current repository I showcase how I persive the idea of a Login, with all the basic scenarios. 
I would like to integrate things like field validation, state handling, persistency and design. 

# Libraries used
- Hilt
- Material Compose

# Future Improvements
- improve state communication
- add storage to save session once the services are done
- field validation and error communication
- Split into modules each feature, so far the app contain the modules but would be great to have them separate and have also a test shared module. 
- Make sure how data is passed to the screens, to be able to test UI better
